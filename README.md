# MyBlog

The blog management system is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the creation, management, and administration of blog content. It features robust CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, with administrators having additional privileges to manage all content. The application includes a dedicated admin panel for tracking user activity and overseeing content efficiently. Secure authentication is implemented using JWT-based session management, with passwords securely hashed using bcrypt to ensure user data protection. The frontend, built with React.js, HTML, CSS, Flowbite, and Tailwind CSS, delivers a responsive and user-friendly interface, while the backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, ensures reliable API handling. MongoDB serves as the database, providing flexible and scalable data storage. Deployed on a cloud-based hosting platform, the application is designed to be scalable and reliable. This project demonstrates expertise in full-stack development, combining modern tools and best practices to deliver a secure and efficient solution for dynamic content management.
